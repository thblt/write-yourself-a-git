  (August 2023) Wyag is now complete!
#+end_note

This article is an attempt at explaining the [[https://git-scm.com/][Git version control
system]] from the bottom up, that is, starting at the most fundamental
level moving up from there.  This does not sound too easy, and has
been attempted multiple times with questionable success.  But there's
an easy way: all it takes to understand Git internals is to
reimplement Git from scratch.

No, don't run.

#+NAME: slocs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports none
  ;; Compute line numbers.  We'll use that in a second.
  (shell-command-to-string
   "grep -v '^$' libwyag.py wyag | grep -v ' *#'  | wc -l")
#+end_src

It's not a joke, and it's really not complicated: if you read this
article top to bottom and write the code (or just [[./wyag.zip][download it]] as a ZIP
--- but you should write the code yourself, really), you'll end up
with a program, called =wyag=, that will implement all the fundamental
features of git: =init=, =add=, =rm=, =status=, =commit=, =log=... in
a way that is perfectly compatible with =git= itself --- compatible
enough that the commit finally adding the section on commits was
[[https://github.com/thblt/write-yourself-a-git/commit/ed26daffb400b2be5f30e044c3237d220226d867][created by wyag itself, not git]].  And all that in exactly call_slocs()
lines of very simple Python code.

But isn't Git too complex for that?  That Git is complex is, in my
opinion, a misconception.  Git is a large program, with a lot of
features, that's true.  But the core of that program is actually
extremely simple, and its apparent complexity stems first from the
fact it's often deeply counterintuitive (and [[https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/][Git is a burrito]] blog
posts probably don't help).  But maybe what makes Git the most
confusing is the extreme simplicity /and/ power of its core model.  The
combination of core simplicity and powerful applications often makes
thing really hard to grasp, because of the mental jump required to
derive the variety of applications from the essential simplicity of
the fundamental abstraction (monads, anyone?)

Implementing Git will expose its fundamentals in all their naked
glory.

*What to expect?*  This article will implement and explain in great
details (if something is not clear, please [[#feedback][report it]]!) a very
simplified version of Git core commands.  I will keep the code simple
and to the point, so =wyag= won't come anywhere near the power of the
real git command-line --- but what's missing will be obvious, and
trivial to implement by anyone who wants to give it a try.  "Upgrading
wyag to a full-featured git library and CLI is left as an exercise to
the reader", as they say.

More precisely, we'll implement:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports results :results list
  (mapcar
   (lambda (cmd)
     (format "=%s= ([[#cmd-%s][wyag source]]) [[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-%s][git man page]]" cmd cmd cmd))
   (list
    "add"
    "cat-file"
    "check-ignore"
    "checkout"
    "commit"
    "hash-object"
    "init"
    "log"
    "ls-files"
    "ls-tree"
    "rev-parse"
    "rm"
    "show-ref"
    "status"
    "tag"))
#+end_src

You're not going to need to know much to follow this article: just
some basic Git (obviously), some basic Python, some basic shell.

 + First, I'm only going to assume some level of familiarity with the
   most basic *git commands* --- nothing like an expert level, but if
   you've never used =init=, =add=, =rm=, =commit= or =checkout=, you will be
   lost.
 + Language-wise, wyag will be implemented in *Python*.  Again, I won't
   use anything too fancy, and Python looks like pseudo-code anyways,
   so it will be easy to follow (ironically, the most complicated part
   will be the command-line arguments parsing logic, and you don't
   really need to understand that).  Yet, if you know programming but
   have never done any Python, I suggest you find a crash course
   somewhere in the internet just to get acquainted with the language.
 + =wyag= and =git= are terminal programs.  I assume you know your way
   inside a Unix terminal.  Again, you don't need to be a l77t h4x0r,
   but =cd=, =ls=, =rm=, =tree= and their friends should be in your toolbox.

#+BEGIN_warning
  *Note for Windows users*

  =wyag= should run on any Unix-like system with a Python interpreter,
  but I have absolutely no idea how it will behave on Windows.  The
  test suite absolutely requires a bash-compatible shell, which I
  assume the WSL can provide.  Also, if you are using WSL, make sure
  your =wyag= file uses Unix-style line endings ([[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48692741/how-can-i-make-all-line-endings-eols-in-all-files-in-visual-studio-code-unix][See this
  StackOverflow solution if you use VS Code]]).  Feedback from Windows
  users would be appreciated!

* Getting started
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
:END:

You're going to need Python 3.10 or higher, along with your
favorite text editor.  We won't need third party packages or
virtualenvs, or anything besides a regular Python interpreter:
everything we need is in Python's standard library.

We'll split the code into two files:

 - An executable, called =wyag=;
 - A Python library, called =libwyag.py=;

Now, every software project starts with a boatload of boilerplate, so let's
get this over with.

We'll begin by creating the (very short) executable.  Create a new
file called =wyag= in your text editor, and copy the following few
lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle wyag :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
  #!/usr/bin/env python3

  import libwyag
  libwyag.main()
#+END_SRC

Then make it executable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ chmod +x wyag
#+END_EXAMPLE

You're done!

# This is a noweb template to include in all three source files.

#+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py :exports none :noweb yes
# <<file_header>>

   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle wyag :exports none :noweb yes

# <<file_header>>
   #+END_SRC

Now for the library.  it must be called =libwyag.py=, and be in the same
directory as the =wyag= executable.  Begin by opening the empty =libwyag.py= in your
text editor.

We're first going to need a bunch of imports (just copy each import,
or merge them all in a single line)

 - Git is a CLI application, so we'll need something to parse
   command-line arguments.  Python provides a cool module called
   [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html][argparse]] that can do 99% of the job for us.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import argparse
   #+END_SRC

 - We'll need a few more container types than the base lib provides,
   most notably an =OrderedDict=.  It's in [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict][collections]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import collections
   #+END_SRC

 - Git uses a configuration file format that is basically Microsoft's
   INI format.  The [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html][configparser]] module can read and write these
   files.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import configparser
   #+END_SRC

 - We'll be doing some date/time manipulation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
     from datetime import datetime
   #+END_SRC

 - We'll need, just once, to read the users/group database on Unix
   (=grp= is for groups, =pwd= for users).  This is because git saves
   the numerical owner/group ID of files, and we'll want to display
   that nicely (as text):

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
     import grp, pwd
   #+END_SRC

 - To support =.gitignore=, we'll need to match filenames against
   patterns like *.txt.  Filename matching is in… =fnmatch=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
     from fnmatch import fnmatch
   #+END_SRC

 - Git uses the SHA-1 function quite extensively.  In Python, it's in [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html][hashlib]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import hashlib
   #+END_SRC

 - Just one function from [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html][math]]:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   from math import ceil
   #+END_SRC

 - [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html][os]] and [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html][os.path]] provide some nice filesystem abstraction routines.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import os
   #+END_SRC

 - we use /just a bit/ of regular expressions:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import re
   #+END_SRC

 - We also need [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html][sys]] to access the actual command-line arguments (in =sys.argv=):

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import sys
   #+END_SRC

 - Git compresses everything using zlib.  Python [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html][has that]], too:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   import zlib
   #+END_SRC

Imports are done.  We'll be working with command-line arguments a lot.
Python provides a simple yet reasonably powerful parsing library,
=argparse=.  It's a nice library, but its interface may not be the most
intuitive ever; if need, refer to its [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html][documentation]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="The stupidest content tracker")
#+END_SRC

We'll need to handle subcommands (as in git: =init=, =commit=, etc.)  In
argparse slang, these are called "subparsers".  At this point we only
need to declare that our CLI will use some, and that all invocation
will actually /require/ one --- you don't just call =git=, you
call =git COMMAND=.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsubparsers = argparser.add_subparsers(title="Commands", dest="command")
  argsubparsers.required = True
#+END_SRC

The ~dest="command"~ argument states that the name of the chosen
subparser will be returned as a string in a field called =command=.
So we just need to read this string and call the correct function
accordingly.  By convention, I'll call these functions "bridges
functions" and prefix their names by =cmd_=.  Bridge functions
take the parsed arguments as their unique parameter, and are
responsible for processing and validating them before executing the
actual command.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def main(argv=sys.argv[1:]):
      args = argparser.parse_args(argv)
      match args.command:
          case "add"          : cmd_add(args)
          case "cat-file"     : cmd_cat_file(args)
          case "check-ignore" : cmd_check_ignore(args)
          case "checkout"     : cmd_checkout(args)
          case "commit"       : cmd_commit(args)
          case "hash-object"  : cmd_hash_object(args)
          case "init"         : cmd_init(args)
          case "log"          : cmd_log(args)
          case "ls-files"     : cmd_ls_files(args)
          case "ls-tree"      : cmd_ls_tree(args)
          case "rev-parse"    : cmd_rev_parse(args)
          case "rm"           : cmd_rm(args)
          case "show-ref"     : cmd_show_ref(args)
          case "status"       : cmd_status(args)
          case "tag"          : cmd_tag(args)
          case _              : print("Bad command.")
#+END_SRC

* Creating repositories: init
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: init
:END:

Obviously, the first Git command in chronological /and/ logical order is
=git init=, so we'll begin by creating =wyag init=.  To achieve this,
we're going to first need some very basic repository abstraction.

** The Repository object
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: GitRepository
:END:

We'll obviously need some abstraction for a repository: almost every
time we run a git command, we're trying to do something to a
repository, to create it, read from it or modify it.

A git repository is made of two things: a "work tree", where the
files meant to be in version control live, and a "git directory",
where Git stores its own data.  In most cases, the worktree is a
regular directory and the git directory is a child directory of the
worktree, called =.git=.

Git supports /much more/ cases (bare repo, separated gitdir, etc) but we
won't need them: we'll stick the basic approach of =worktree/.git=.  Our
repository object will then just hold two paths: the worktree and the
gitdir.

To create a new =Repository= object, we only need to make a few checks:

 - We must verify that the directory exists, and contains a
   subdirectory called =.git=.

 - We read its configuration in =.git/config= (it's just an INI file)
   and control that =core.repositoryformatversion= is 0.  More on that
   field in a moment.

The constructor takes an optional =force= which disables all checks.
That's because the =repo_create()= function which we'll create later uses
a =Repository= object to /create/ the repo.  So we need a way to create
repository even from (still) invalid filesystem locations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitRepository (object):
      """A git repository"""

      worktree = None
      gitdir = None
      conf = None

      def __init__(self, path, force=False):
          self.worktree = path
          self.gitdir = os.path.join(path, ".git")

          if not (force or os.path.isdir(self.gitdir)):
              raise Exception("Not a Git repository %s" % path)

          # Read configuration file in .git/config
          self.conf = configparser.ConfigParser()
          cf = repo_file(self, "config")

          if cf and os.path.exists(cf):
              self.conf.read([cf])
          elif not force:
              raise Exception("Configuration file missing")

          if not force:
              vers = int(self.conf.get("core", "repositoryformatversion"))
              if vers != 0:
                  raise Exception("Unsupported repositoryformatversion %s" % vers)
#+END_SRC

We're going to be manipulating *lots* of paths in repositories.  We may
as well create a few utility functions to compute those paths and
create missing directory structures if needed.  First, just a general
path building function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
def repo_path(repo, *path):
    """Compute path under repo's gitdir."""
    return os.path.join(repo.gitdir, *path)
#+END_SRC

(A note on Python syntax: the star on the =*path= makes the function
variadic, so it can be called with multiple path components as
separate arguments.  For example, ~repo_path(repo, "objects", "df",
"4ec9fc2ad990cb9da906a95a6eda6627d7b7b0")~ is a valid call.  The
function receives =path= as a list)

The two next functions, =repo_file()= and =repo_dir()=, return and
optionally create a path to a file or a directory, respectively.  The
difference between them is that the file version only creates
directories up to the last component.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def repo_file(repo, *path, mkdir=False):
      """Same as repo_path, but create dirname(*path) if absent.  For
  example, repo_file(r, \"refs\", \"remotes\", \"origin\", \"HEAD\") will create
  .git/refs/remotes/origin."""

      if repo_dir(repo, *path[:-1], mkdir=mkdir):
          return repo_path(repo, *path)

  def repo_dir(repo, *path, mkdir=False):
      """Same as repo_path, but mkdir *path if absent if mkdir."""

      path = repo_path(repo, *path)

      if os.path.exists(path):
          if (os.path.isdir(path)):
              return path
          else:
              raise Exception("Not a directory %s" % path)

      if mkdir:
          os.makedirs(path)
          return path
      else:
          return None
#+END_SRC

(Second and last note on syntax: because the star in =*path= makes the
functions variadic, the =mkdir= argument must be passed explicitly by
name.  For example, ~repo_file(repo, "objects", mkdir=True)~.)

To *create* a new repository, we start with a directory (which we
create if doesn't already exist) and create the *git directory* inside
(which must not exist already, or be empty).  That directory is called
=.git= (the leading period makes it "hidden" on Unix systems), and contains:

 - =.git/objects/= : the object store, which we'll introduce [[#objects][in the next section]].
 - =.git/refs/= the reference store, which we'll discuss [[#cmd-show-ref][a bit later]].
   It contains two subdirectories, =heads= and =tags=.
 - =.git/HEAD=, a reference to the current HEAD (more on that later!)
 - =.git/config=, the repository's configuration file.
 - =.git/description=, holds a free-form description of this
   repository's contents, for humans, and is rarely used.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def repo_create(path):
      """Create a new repository at path."""

      repo = GitRepository(path, True)

      # First, we make sure the path either doesn't exist or is an
      # empty dir.

      if os.path.exists(repo.worktree):
          if not os.path.isdir(repo.worktree):
              raise Exception ("%s is not a directory!" % path)
          if os.path.exists(repo.gitdir) and os.listdir(repo.gitdir):
              raise Exception("%s is not empty!" % path)
      else:
          os.makedirs(repo.worktree)

      assert repo_dir(repo, "objects", mkdir=True)
      assert repo_dir(repo, "refs", "tags", mkdir=True)
      assert repo_dir(repo, "refs", "heads", mkdir=True)

      # .git/description
      with open(repo_file(repo, "description"), "w") as f:
          f.write("Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the repository.\n")

      # .git/HEAD
      with open(repo_file(repo, "HEAD"), "w") as f:
          f.write("ref: refs/heads/master\n")

      with open(repo_file(repo, "config"), "w") as f:
          config = repo_default_config()
          config.write(f)

      return repo
#+END_SRC

The configuration file is very simple, it's a INI-like file with a
single section (=[core]=) and three fields:

 - =repositoryformatversion = 0=: the version of
   the gitdir format.  0 means the initial format, 1 the same with
   extensions.  If > 1, git will panic; wyag will only accept 0.
 - =filemode = false=: disable tracking of file mode (permissions) changes in the work tree.
 - =bare = false=: indicates that this repository has a worktree.  Git
   supports an optional =worktree= key which indicates the location of
   the worktree, if not =..=; wyag doesn't.

We create this file using Python's =configparser= lib:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
def repo_default_config():
    ret = configparser.ConfigParser()

    ret.add_section("core")
    ret.set("core", "repositoryformatversion", "0")
    ret.set("core", "filemode", "false")
    ret.set("core", "bare", "false")

    return ret
#+END_SRC

** The init command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-init
:END:

Now that we have code to read and create repositories, let's make this
code usable from the command line by creating the =wyag init= command.
=wyag init= behaves just like =git init= --- with much less
customizability, of course.  The syntax of =wyag init= is going to be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  wyag init [path]
#+END_EXAMPLE

We already have the complete repository creation logic.  To create the
command, we're only going to need two more things:

1. We need to create an argparse subparser to handle our command's
   argument.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("init", help="Initialize a new, empty repository.")
   #+END_SRC

   In the case of =init=, there's a single, optional,
   positional argument: the path where to init the repo.  It defaults
   to =.=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
    argsp.add_argument("path",
                       metavar="directory",
                       nargs="?",
                       default=".",
                       help="Where to create the repository.")

    #+END_SRC

2. We also need a "bridge" function that will read argument values
   from the object returned by argparse and call the actual
   function with correct values.

    #+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
    def cmd_init(args):
        repo_create(args.path)
    #+END_SRC

And we're done!  If you've followed these steps, you should now be
able to =wyag init= a git repository anywhere:

#+begin_example
  $ wyag init test
#+end_example

** The repo_find() function
:PROPERTIES:
:repo_find:
:END:

While we're implementing repositories, we're going to need a function
to find the root of the current repository.  We'll use it a lot, since
almost all Git functions work on an existing repository (except
=init=, of course!).  Sometimes that root is the current directory,
but it may also be a parent: your repository's root may be in
=~/Documents/MyProject=, but you may currently be working in
=~/Documents/MyProject/src/tui/frames/mainview/=.  The =repo_find()=
function we'll now create will look for that root, starting at the
current directory and recursing back to =/=.  To identify a path as a
repository, it will check for the presence of a =.git= directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
def repo_find(path=".", required=True):
    path = os.path.realpath(path)

    if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(path, ".git")):
        return GitRepository(path)

    # If we haven't returned, recurse in parent, if w
    parent = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(path, ".."))

    if parent == path:
        # Bottom case
        # os.path.join("/", "..") == "/":
        # If parent==path, then path is root.
        if required:
            raise Exception("No git directory.")
        else:
            return None

    # Recursive case
    return repo_find(parent, required)
#+END_SRC

And we're done with repositories!

* Reading and writing objects: hash-object and cat-file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: objects
:END:

** What are objects?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: objects-intro
:END:

Now that we have repositories, putting things inside them is in order.
Also, repositories are boring, and writing a Git implementation
shouldn't be just a matter of writing a bunch of =mkdir=.  Let's talk
about *objects*, and let's implement =git hash-object= and =git cat-file=.

Maybe you don't know these two commands --- they're not exactly part
of an everyday git toolbox, and they're actually quite low-level
("plumbing", in git parlance).  What they do is actually very simple:
=hash-object= converts an existing file into a git object, and =cat-file=
prints an existing git object to the standard output.

Now, *what actually is a Git object?* At its core, Git is a
"content-addressed filesystem".  That means that unlike regular
filesystems, where the name of a file is arbitrary and unrelated to
that file's contents, the names of files as stored by Git are
mathematically derived from their contents.  This has a very important
implication: if a single byte of, say, a text file, changes, its
internal name will change, too.  To put it simply: you don't /modify/
a file, you create a new file in a different location.  Objects are
just that: *files in the git repository, whose paths are determined by
their contents*.

#+begin_warning
*Git is not (really) a key-value store*

Some documentation, including the excellent [[https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects][Pro Git]], call Git a
"key-value store".  This is not incorrect, but may be misleading.
Regular filesystems are actually closer to a key-value store than Git
is.  Because it computes keys from data, Git should rather be called a
/value-value store/.
#+end_warning

Git uses objects to store quite a lot of things: first and foremost,
the actual files it keeps in version control --- source code, for
example.  Commit are objects, too, as well as tags.  With a few
notable exceptions (which we'll see later!), almost everything, in
Git, is stored as an object.

The path is computed by calculating the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1][SHA-1]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function][hash]] of its contents.
More precisely, Git renders the hash as a lowercase hexadecimal
string, and splits it in two parts: the first two characters, and the
rest.  It uses the first part as a directory name, the rest as the
file name (this is because most filesystems hate having too many files
in a single directory and would slow down to a crawl.  Git's method
creates 256 possible intermediate directories, hence dividing the
average number of files per directory by 256)

#+BEGIN_note
*What is a hash function?*

Simply put, a hash function is a kind of unidirectional mathematical
function: it is easy to compute the hash of a value, but there's no
way to compute which value produced a hash.  A very simple example of
a hash function is the classical =len= (or =strlen=) function, that
returns the length of a string.  It's really easy to compute the
length of a string, and the length of a given string will never change
(unless the string itself changes, of course!) but it's impossible to
retrieve the original string, given only its length.  /Cryptographic/
hash functions are just a much more complex version of the same, with
the added property that computing an input meant to produce a given
hash is hard enough to be practically impossible.  (To produce an
input =i= with ~strlen(i) == 12~, you just type twelve random
characters.  With algorithms such as SHA-1. it would take much, much
longer --- long enough to be practically impossible[fn:1]).
#+END_note

Before we start implementing the object storage system, we must
understand their exact storage format.  An object starts with a header
that specifies its type: =blob=, =commit=, =tag= or =tree= (more on
that in a second).  This header is followed by an ASCII space (0x20),
then the size of the object in bytes as an ASCII number, then null
(0x00) (the null byte), then the contents of the object.  The first 48
bytes of a commit object in Wyag's repo look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
00000000  63 6f 6d 6d 69 74 20 31  30 38 36 00 74 72 65 65  |commit 1086.tree|
00000010  20 32 39 66 66 31 36 63  39 63 31 34 65 32 36 35  | 29ff16c9c14e265|
00000020  32 62 32 32 66 38 62 37  38 62 62 30 38 61 35 61  |2b22f8b78bb08a5a|
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the first line, we see the type header, a space (=0x20=), the size in
ASCII (1086) and the null separator =0x00=.  The last four bytes on the
first line are the beginning of that object's contents, the word
"tree" --- we'll discuss that further when we'll talk about commits.

The objects (headers and contents) are stored compressed with =zlib=.

** A generic object object

Objects can be of multiple types, but they all share the same
storage/retrieval mechanism and the same general header format.
Before we dive into the details of various types of objects, we need
to abstract over these common features.  The easiest way is to create
a generic =GitObject= with two unimplemented methods: =serialize()=
and =deserialize()=, and a default =init()= to create a new, empty
object if needed (sorry pythonistas, this isn't very nice design but
it's probably easier to read than superconstructors).  Our __init__
either loads the object from the provided data, or calls the
subclass-provided =init()= to create a new, empty object.

Later, we'll subclass this generic class, actually implementing these
functions for each object format.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
class GitObject (object):

    def __init__(self, data=None):
        if data != None:
            self.deserialize(data)
        else:
            self.init()

    def serialize(self, repo):
        """This function MUST be implemented by subclasses.

It must read the object's contents from self.data, a byte string, and do
whatever it takes to convert it into a meaningful representation.  What exactly that means depend on each subclass."""
        raise Exception("Unimplemented!")

    def deserialize(self, data):
        raise Exception("Unimplemented!")

    def init(self):
        pass # Just do nothing. This is a reasonable default!
#+END_SRC

** Reading objects
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: object_read
:END:

To read an object, we need to know its hash.  We then compute its path
from this hash (with the formula explained above: first two
characters, then a directory delimiter =/=, then the remaining part) and
look it up inside of the "objects" directory in the gitdir.  That is,
the path to =e673d1b7eaa0aa01b5bc2442d570a765bdaae751= is
=.git/objects/e6/73d1b7eaa0aa01b5bc2442d570a765bdaae751=.

We then read that file as a binary file, and decompress it using
=zlib=.

From the decompressed data, we extract the two header components: the
object type and its size.   From the type, we determine the actual
class to use.   We convert the size to a Python integer, and check if
it matches.

When all is done, we just call the correct constructor for that
object's format.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def object_read(repo, sha):
      """Read object sha from Git repository repo.  Return a
      GitObject whose exact type depends on the object."""

      path = repo_file(repo, "objects", sha[0:2], sha[2:])

      if not os.path.isfile(path):
          return None

      with open (path, "rb") as f:
          raw = zlib.decompress(f.read())

          # Read object type
          x = raw.find(b' ')
          fmt = raw[0:x]

          # Read and validate object size
          y = raw.find(b'\x00', x)
          size = int(raw[x:y].decode("ascii"))
          if size != len(raw)-y-1:
              raise Exception("Malformed object {0}: bad length".format(sha))

          # Pick constructor
          match fmt:
              case b'commit' : c=GitCommit
              case b'tree'   : c=GitTree
              case b'tag'    : c=GitTag
              case b'blob'   : c=GitBlob
              case _:
                  raise Exception("Unknown type {0} for object {1}".format(fmt.decode("ascii"), sha))

          # Call constructor and return object
          return c(raw[y+1:])
#+END_SRC

** Writing objects
:PROPERTIES:
:object_write:
:END:

Writing an object is reading it in reverse: we compute the hash,
insert the header, zlib-compress everything and write the result in
place.  This really shouldn't require much explanation, just notice
that the hash is computed *after* the header is added.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def object_write(obj, repo=None):
      # Serialize object data
      data = obj.serialize()
      # Add header
      result = obj.fmt + b' ' + str(len(data)).encode() + b'\x00' + data
      # Compute hash
      sha = hashlib.sha1(result).hexdigest()

      if repo:
          # Compute path
          path=repo_file(repo, "objects", sha[0:2], sha[2:], mkdir=True)

          if not os.path.exists(path):
              with open(path, 'wb') as f:
                  # Compress and write
                  f.write(zlib.compress(result))
      return sha
#+END_SRC

** Working with blobs

We said earlier that the type header could be one of four: =blob=,
=commit=, =tag= and =tree= --- so git has four object types.

Out of those four types, blobs are the simplest, because they have no
actual format.  Blobs are user data: the content of every file you
put in git (=main.c=, =logo.png=, =README.md=) is stored as a blob.
That makes them easy to manipulate, because they have no actual syntax
or constraints beyond the basic object storage mechanism: they're just
unspecified data.  Creating a =GitBlob= class is thus trivial, the
=serialize= and =deserialize= functions just have to store and return
their input unmodified.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitBlob(GitObject):
      fmt=b'blob'

      def serialize(self):
          return self.blobdata

      def deserialize(self, data):
          self.blobdata = data
#+END_SRC

** The cat-file command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-cat-file
:END:

With all that, we can now create =wyag cat-file=.  =git cat-file=
simply prints the raw contents of an object to stdout, just
uncompressed and header removed.  In a copy of [[https://github.com/thblt/write-yourself-a-git][wyag's source
repository]], =git cat-file blob
e0695f14a412c29e252c998c81de1dde59658e4a= will show a version of the
README.

Our simplified version will just take those two positional arguments:
a type and an object identifier:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  wyag cat-file TYPE OBJECT
#+END_EXAMPLE

The subparser is very simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("cat-file",
                                   help="Provide content of repository objects")

  argsp.add_argument("type",
                     metavar="type",
                     choices=["blob", "commit", "tag", "tree"],
                     help="Specify the type")

  argsp.add_argument("object",
                     metavar="object",
                     help="The object to display")
#+END_SRC

And we can implement the functions, which just call into other logic:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_cat_file(args):
      repo = repo_find()
      cat_file(repo, args.object, fmt=args.type.encode())

  def cat_file(repo, obj, fmt=None):
      obj = object_read(repo, object_find(repo, obj, fmt=fmt))
      sys.stdout.buffer.write(obj.serialize())
#+END_SRC

<<placeholder-object_find>> This function calls an =object_find=
function we haven't introduced yet.  For now, it's just going to
return one of its arguments unmodified, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def object_find(repo, name, fmt=None, follow=True):
    return name
#+END_SRC

The reason for this strange small function is that Git has a /lot/ of
ways to refer to objects: full hash, short hash, tags...
=object_find()= will be our name resolution function.  We'll only
implement it [[#object_find][later]], so this is just a temporary placeholder (so our
code can run already, without the real version).  This means that
until we implement the real thing, the only way we can refer to an
object will be by its full hash.

** The hash-object command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-hash-object
:END:

We will want to put our /own/ data in our repositories,
though. =hash-object= is basically the opposite of =cat-file=: it
reads a file, computes its hash as an object, either storing it in the
repository (if the -w flag is passed) or just printing its hash.

The basic syntax of =git hash-object= looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  git hash-object [-w] [-t TYPE] FILE
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which converts to:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser(
      "hash-object",
      help="Compute object ID and optionally creates a blob from a file")

  argsp.add_argument("-t",
                     metavar="type",
                     dest="type",
                     choices=["blob", "commit", "tag", "tree"],
                     default="blob",
                     help="Specify the type")

  argsp.add_argument("-w",
                     dest="write",
                     action="store_true",
                     help="Actually write the object into the database")

  argsp.add_argument("path",
                     help="Read object from <file>")
#+END_SRC

The actual implementation is very simple.  As usual, we create a small
bridge function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_hash_object(args):
      if args.write:
          repo = repo_find()
      else:
          repo = None

      with open(args.path, "rb") as fd:
          sha = object_hash(fd, args.type.encode(), repo)
          print(sha)
#+END_SRC

and the actual implementation.  The =repo= argument is optional, and the
object isn't written if it is =None= (this is handled in =object_write()=, above):

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
    def object_hash(fd, fmt, repo=None):
        """ Hash object, writing it to repo if provided."""
        data = fd.read()

        # Choose constructor according to fmt argument
        match fmt:
            case b'commit' : obj=GitCommit(data)
            case b'tree'   : obj=GitTree(data)
            case b'tag'    : obj=GitTag(data)
            case b'blob'   : obj=GitBlob(data)
            case _: raise Exception("Unknown type %s!" % fmt)

        return object_write(obj, repo)
#+END_SRC

** Aside: what about packfiles?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: packfiles
:END:

What we've just implemented is called "loose objects".  Git has a
second object storage mechanism called packfiles.  Packfiles are much
more efficient, but also much more complex, than loose objects.  Simply
put, a packfile is a compilation of loose objects (like a =tar=) but
some are stored as deltas (as a transformation of another object).
Packfiles are way too complex to be supported by wyag.

The packfile is stored in =.git/objects/pack/=.  It has a =.pack=
extension, and is accompanied by an index file of the same name with
the =.idx= extension.  Should you want to convert a packfile to loose
objects format (to play with =wyag= on an existing repo, for example),
here's the solution.

First, /move/ the packfile outside the gitdir (just copying it won't work).

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mv .git/objects/pack/pack-d9ef004d4ca729287f12aaaacf36fee39baa7c9d.pack .
#+END_SRC

You can ignore the =.idx=.  Then, from the worktree, just =cat= it and pipe the result to =git
unpack-objects=:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cat pack-d9ef004d4ca729287f12aaaacf36fee39baa7c9d.pack | git unpack-objects
#+END_SRC

* Reading commit history: log

** Parsing commits

Now that we can read and write objects, we should consider commits.
A commit object (uncompressed, without headers) looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

Create first draft
#+END_EXAMPLE

The format is a simplified version of mail messages, as specified in
[[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt][RFC 2822]].  It begins with a series of key-value pairs, with space as
the key/value separator, and ends with the commit message, that may
span over multiple lines.  Values may continue over multiple lines,
subsequent lines start with a space which the parser must drop (like
the =gpgsig= field above, which spans over 16 lines).

Let's have a look at those fields:

- =tree= is a reference to a tree object, a type of object that we'll
  see just next.  A tree maps blobs IDs to filesystem locations, and
  describes a state of the work tree.  Put simply, it is the actual
  content of the commit: file contents, and where they go.
- =parent= is a reference to the parent of this commit.  It may be
  repeated: merge commits, for example, have multiple parents.  It
  may also be absent: the very first commit in a repository obviously
  doesn't have a parent.
- =author= and =committer= are separate, because the author of a commit
  is not necessarily the person who can commit it (This may not be
  obvious for GitHub users, but a lot of projects do Git through e-mail)
- =gpgsig= is the PGP signature of this object.

We'll start by writing a simple parser for the format.  The code is
obvious.  The name of the function we're about to create,
=kvlm_parse()=, may be confusing: it isn't called =commit_parse()= because
tags have the very same format, so we'll use it for both objects types.
I use KVLM to mean "Key-Value List with Message".

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
   def kvlm_parse(raw, start=0, dct=None):
       if not dct:
           dct = collections.OrderedDict()
           # You CANNOT declare the argument as dct=OrderedDict() or all
           # call to the functions will endlessly grow the same dict.

       # This function is recursive: it reads a key/value pair, then call
       # itself back with the new position.  So we first need to know
       # where we are: at a keyword, or already in the messageQ

       # We search for the next space and the next newline.
       spc = raw.find(b' ', start)
       nl = raw.find(b'\n', start)

       # If space appears before newline, we have a keyword.  Otherwise,
       # it's the final message, which we just read to the end of the file.

       # Base case
       # =========
       # If newline appears first (or there's no space at all, in which
       # case find returns -1), we assume a blank line.  A blank line
       # means the remainder of the data is the message.  We store it in
       # the dictionary, with None as the key, and return.

We use an =OrderedDict= (a dictionary/hashmap where keys are ordered)
so fields always appear in the same order.  This matters, because Git
has *two strong rules about object identity*:

 1. The first rule is that *the same name will always refer to the
    same object*.  We've seen this one already, it's just a
    consequence of the fact that an object's name is a hash of its
    contents.
 2. The second rule is subtly different: *the same object will always
    be referred by the same name*.  This means that there shouldn't be
    two equivalent objects under different names.  This is why fields
    order matter: by modifying the /order/ fields appear in a given
    commit, eg by putting the =tree= after the =parent=, we'd modify
    the SHA-1 hash of the commit, and we'd create two equivalent, but
    numerically distinct, commit objects.

For example, when comparing trees, git will assume that two trees with
different names /are/ different --- this is why we'll have to make
sure elements of the tree objects are properly sorted, so we don't
produce distinct but equivalent trees.
#+end_note

We're also going to need to write similar objects, so let's add a
=kvlm_serialize()= function to our toolkit.  This is very simple: we
write all fields first, then a newline, the message, and a final
newline.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def kvlm_serialize(kvlm):
      ret = b''

      # Output fields
      for k in kvlm.keys():
          # Skip the message itself
          if k == None: continue
          val = kvlm[k]
          # Normalize to a list
          if type(val) != list:
              val = [ val ]

          for v in val:
              ret += k + b' ' + (v.replace(b'\n', b'\n ')) + b'\n'

      # Append message
      ret += b'\n' + kvlm[None] + b'\n'

      return ret
#+END_SRC

** The Commit object
:PROPERTIES:
:object_write: GitCommit
:END:

Now we have the parser, we can create the =GitCommit= class:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitCommit(GitObject):
      fmt=b'commit'

      def deserialize(self, data):
          self.kvlm = kvlm_parse(data)

      def serialize(self):
          return kvlm_serialize(self.kvlm)

      def init(self):
          self.kvlm = dict()
#+END_SRC

** The log command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-log
:END:

We'll implement a much, much simpler version of =log= than what Git
provides.  Most importantly, we won't deal with representing the log
/at all/.  Instead, we'll dump Graphviz data and let the user use
=dot= to render the actual log.  (If you don't know how to use
Graphviz, just paste the raw output into [[https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/][this site]].  If the link is
dead, lookup "graphviz online" in your favorite search engine)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("log", help="Display history of a given commit.")
  argsp.add_argument("commit",
                     default="HEAD",
                     nargs="?",
                     help="Commit to start at.")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_log(args):
      repo = repo_find()

      print("digraph wyaglog{")
      print("  node[shape=rect]")
      log_graphviz(repo, object_find(repo, args.commit), set())
      print("}")

  def log_graphviz(repo, sha, seen):

      if sha in seen:
          return
      seen.add(sha)

      commit = object_read(repo, sha)
      short_hash = sha[0:8]
      message = commit.kvlm[None].decode("utf8").strip()
      message = message.replace("\\", "\\\\")
      message = message.replace("\"", "\\\"")

      if "\n" in message: # Keep only the first line
          message = message[:message.index("\n")]

      print("  c_{0} [label=\"{1}: {2}\"]".format(sha, sha[0:7], message))
      assert commit.fmt==b'commit'

      if not b'parent' in commit.kvlm.keys():
          # Base case: the initial commit.
          return

      parents = commit.kvlm[b'parent']

      if type(parents) != list:
          parents = [ parents ]

      for p in parents:
          p = p.decode("ascii")
          print ("  c_{0} -> c_{1};".format(sha, p))
          log_graphviz(repo, p, seen)
#+END_SRC

You can now use our log command like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  wyag log e03158242ecab460f31b0d6ae1642880577ccbe8 > log.dot
  dot -O -Tpdf log.dot
#+END_SRC

** Anatomy of a commit
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: commit-anatomy
:END:

You may have noticed a few things right now.

First and foremost, we've been playing with commits, browsing and
walking through commit objects, building a graph of commit history,
without ever touching a single file in the worktree or a blob.  We've
done a lot with commits /without considering their contents/.  This is
important: work tree contents are just one part of a commit.  But a
commit is made of everything it holds: its contents, its authors,
*also its parents*.  If you remember that the ID (the SHA-1 hash) of a
commit is computed from the whole commit object, you'll understand
what it means that commits are immutable: if you change the author,
the parent commit or a single file, you've actually created a new,
different object.  Each and every commit is bound to its place and its
relationship to the whole repository up to the very first commit.  To
put it otherwise, a given commit ID not only identifies some file
contents, but it also binds the commit to its whole history and to the
whole repository.

It's also worth noting that from the point of view of a commit, time
somehow runs backwards: we're used to considering the history of a
project from its humble beginnings as an evening distraction, starting
with a few lines of code, some initial commits, and progressing to its
present state (millions of lines of code, dozens of contributors,
whatever).  But each commit is completely unaware of its future, it's
only linked to the past.  Commits have "memory", but no premonition.

# #+begin_note
#   In Terry Pratchett's Discworld, trolls believe they progress in time
#   from the future to the past.  The reasoning behind that belief is
#   that when you walk, what you can see is what's /ahead/ of you.  Of
#   time, all you can perceive is the past, because you remember; hence
#   it's where you're headed.  Commits are Discworld trolls.
# #+end_note

So what makes a commit?  To sum it up:

- A tree object, which we'll discuss now, that is, the contents of a
  worktree, files and directories;
- Zero, one or more parents;
- An author identity (name and email), and a timestamp;
- A committer identity (name and email), and a timestamp;
- An optional PGP signature
- A message;

All this hashed together in a unique SHA-1 identifier.

#+begin_note
  *Wait, does that make Git a blockchain?*

  Because of cryptocurrencies, blockchains are all the hype these
  days.  And yes, /in a way/, Git is a blockchain: it's a sequence of
  blocks (commits) tied together by cryptographic means in a way that
  guarantee that each single element is associated to the whole
  history of the structure.  Don't take the comparison too seriously,
  though: we don't need a GitCoin.  Really, we don't.
#+end_note

* Reading commit data: checkout
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: checkout
:END:

It's all well that commits hold a lot more than files and directories
in a given state, but that doesn't make them really useful.  It's
probably time to start implementing tree objects as well, so we'll be
able to checkout commits into the work tree.

** What's in a tree?

Informally, a tree describes the content of the work tree, that it, it
associates blobs to paths.  It's an array of three-element tuples made
of a file mode, a path (relative to the worktree) and a SHA-1.  A
typical tree contents may look like this:

| Mode     | SHA-1                                      | Path         |
|----------+--------------------------------------------+--------------|
| =100644= | =894a44cc066a027465cd26d634948d56d13af9af= | =.gitignore= |
| =100644= | =94a9ed024d3859793618152ea559a168bbcbb5e2= | =LICENSE=    |
| =100644= | =bab489c4f4600a38ce6dbfd652b90383a4aa3e45= | =README.md=  |
| =100644= | =6d208e47659a2a10f5f8640e0155d9276a2130a9= | =src=        |
| =040000= | =e7445b03aea61ec801b20d6ab62f076208b7d097= | =tests=      |
| =040000= | =d5ec863f17f3a2e92aa8f6b66ac18f7b09fd1b38= | =main.c=     |

Mode is just the file's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions][mode]], path is its location.  The SHA-1 refers
to either a blob or another tree object.  If a blob, the path is a
file, if a tree, it's directory.  To instantiate this tree in the
filesystem, we would begin by loading the object associated to the
first path (=.gitignore=) and check its type.  Since it's a blob,
we'll just create a file called =.gitignore= with this blob's
contents; and same for =LICENSE= and =README.md=.  But the object
associated with =src= is not a blob, but another tree: we'll create
the directory =src= and repeat the same operation in that directory
with the new tree.

#+BEGIN_warning
  *A path is a single filesystem entry*

  The path identifies exactly one file or directory.  Not two, not
  three.  If you have five levels of nested directories, even if four
  are empty save the next directory, you're going to need five tree
  objects recursively referring to one another.  You cannot take the
  shortcut of putting a full path in a single tree entry, like
  =dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/dir5=.
#+END_warning

** Parsing trees

Unlike tags and commits, tree objects are binary objects, but their
format is actually quite simple.  A tree is the concatenation of
records of the format:

#+begin_example
[mode] space [path] 0x00 [sha-1]
#+end_example

- =[mode]= is up to six bytes and is an octal representation of a file
  *mode*, stored in ASCII. For example, 100644 is encoded with byte
  values 49 (ASCII "1"), 48 (ASCII "0"), 48, 54, 52, 52.  The first
  two digits encode the file type (file, directory, symlink or
  submodule), the last four the permissions.
- It's followed by 0x20, an ASCII *space*;
- Followed by the null-terminated (0x00) *path*;
- Followed by the object's *SHA-1* in binary encoding, on 20 bytes.

The parser is going to be quite simple.  First, create a tiny object
wrapper for a single record (a leaf, a single path):

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitTreeLeaf (object):
      def __init__(self, mode, path, sha):
          self.mode = mode
          self.path = path
          self.sha = sha
#+END_SRC

Because a tree object is just the repetition of the same fundamental
data structure, we write the parser in two functions.  First, a parser
to extract a single record, which returns parsed data and the position
it reached in input data:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tree_parse_one(raw, start=0):
      # Find the space terminator of the mode
      x = raw.find(b' ', start)
      assert x-start == 5 or x-start==6

      # Read the mode
      mode = raw[start:x]
      if len(mode) == 5:
          # Normalize to six bytes.
          mode = b" " + mode

      # Find the NULL terminator of the path
      y = raw.find(b'\x00', x)
      # and read the path
      path = raw[x+1:y]

      # Read the SHA and convert to a hex string
      sha = format(int.from_bytes(raw[y+1:y+21], "big"), "040x")
      return y+21, GitTreeLeaf(mode, path.decode("utf8"), sha)
#+END_SRC

And the "real" parser which just calls the previous one in a loop,
until input data is exhausted.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tree_parse(raw):
      pos = 0
      max = len(raw)
      ret = list()
      while pos < max:
          pos, data = tree_parse_one(raw, pos)
          ret.append(data)

      return ret
#+END_SRC

We'll finally need a serializer to write trees back.  Because we may
have added or modified entries, we need to sort them again.
Consistently sorting matters, because we need to respect git's
[[identity-rules][identity rules]], which says that no two equivalent object can have a
different hash --- but differently sorted trees with the same contents
/would/ be equivalent (describing the same directory structure), and
still numerically distinct (different SHA-1 identifiers).  Incorrectly
sorted trees are invalid, but /git doesn't enforce that/.  I created
some invalid trees by accident writing wyag, and all I got was weird
bugs in =git status= (specifically, =status= would report an actually
clean worktree as fully modified).  We don't want that.

The ordering function is quite simple, with an unexpected twist.  are
Entries sorted by name, alphabetically, /but/ directories (that is,
tree entries) are sorted with a final =/= added.  It matters, because
it means that if =whatever= names a regular file, it will sort
/before/ =whatever.c=, but if =whatever= is a dir, it will sort
/after/, as =whatever/=. (I'm not sure why git does that.  If you're
curious, see the function =base_name_compare= in =tree.c= in the git
source)

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  # Notice this isn't a comparison function, but a conversion function.
  # Python's default sort doesn't accept a custom comparison function,
  # like in most languages, but a `key` arguments that returns a new
  # value, which is compared using the default rules.  So we just return
  # the leaf name, with an extra / if it's a directory.
  def tree_leaf_sort_key(leaf):
      if leaf.mode.startswith(b"10"):
          return leaf.path
      else:
          return leaf.path + "/"
#+end_src

Then the serializer itself.  This one is very simple: we sort the
items using our newly created function as a transformer, then write
them in order.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tree_serialize(obj):
      obj.items.sort(key=tree_leaf_sort_key)
      ret = b''
      for i in obj.items:
          ret += i.mode
          ret += b' '
          ret += i.path.encode("utf8")
          ret += b'\x00'
          sha = int(i.sha, 16)
          ret += sha.to_bytes(20, byteorder="big")
      return ret
#+END_SRC

And now we just have to combine all that into a class:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitTree(GitObject):
      fmt=b'tree'

      def deserialize(self, data):
          self.items = tree_parse(data)

      def serialize(self):
          return tree_serialize(self)

      def init(self):
          self.items = list()
#+END_SRC

** The checkout command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-checkout
:END:

=git checkout= simply instantiates a commit in the worktree.  We're
going to oversimplify the actual git command to make our
implementation clear and understandable.  We're also going to add a
few safeguards.  Here's how our version of checkout will work:

- It will take two arguments: a commit, and a directory.  Git checkout
  only needs a commit.

- It will then instantiate the tree in the directory, *if and only if
  the directory is empty*.  Git is full of safeguards to avoid
  deleting data, which would be too complicated and unsafe to try to
  reproduce in wyag.  Since the point of wyag is to demonstrate git,
  not to produce a working implementation, this limitation is
  acceptable.

Let's get started.  As usual, we need a subparser:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("checkout", help="Checkout a commit inside of a directory.")

  argsp.add_argument("commit",
                     help="The commit or tree to checkout.")

  argsp.add_argument("path",
                     help="The EMPTY directory to checkout on.")
#+END_SRC

A wrapper function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_checkout(args):
      repo = repo_find()

      obj = object_read(repo, object_find(repo, args.commit))

      # If the object is a commit, we grab its tree
      if obj.fmt == b'commit':
          obj = object_read(repo, obj.kvlm[b'tree'].decode("ascii"))

      # Verify that path is an empty directory
      if os.path.exists(args.path):
          if not os.path.isdir(args.path):
              raise Exception("Not a directory {0}!".format(args.path))
          if os.listdir(args.path):
              raise Exception("Not empty {0}!".format(args.path))
      else:
          os.makedirs(args.path)

      tree_checkout(repo, obj, os.path.realpath(args.path))
#+END_SRC

And a function to do the actual work:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tree_checkout(repo, tree, path):
      for item in tree.items:
          obj = object_read(repo, item.sha)
          dest = os.path.join(path, item.path)

          if obj.fmt == b'tree':
              os.mkdir(dest)
              tree_checkout(repo, obj, dest)
          elif obj.fmt == b'blob':
              # @TODO Support symlinks (identified by mode 12****)
              with open(dest, 'wb') as f:
                  f.write(obj.blobdata)
#+END_SRC

* Refs, tags and branches
** What a ref is, and the show-ref command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-show-ref
:END:

As of now, the only way we can refer to objects is by their full
hexadecimal identifier.  In git, we actually rarely see those, except
to talk about a specific commit.  But in general, we're talking about
HEAD, about some branch called names like =main= or
=feature/more-bombs=, and so on.  This is handled by a simple
mechanism called references.

Git references, or refs, are probably the most simple type of things
git holds.  They live in subdirectories of =.git/refs=, and are text
files containing a hexadecimal representation of an object's hash,
encoded in ASCII.  They're actually as simple as this:

#+BEGIN_example
  6071c08bcb4757d8c89a30d9755d2466cef8c1de
#+END_example

Refs can also refer to another reference, and thus only indirectly to
an object, in which case they look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ref: refs/remotes/origin/master
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_note
  *Direct and indirect references*

  From now on, I will call a reference of the form =ref:
  path/to/other/ref= an *indirect* reference, and a ref with a SHA-1
  object ID a *direct reference*.
#+END_note

This section will describe the uses of refs.  For now, all that matter
is this:

- they're text files, in the =.git/refs= hierarchy;
- they hold the SHA-1 identifier of an object, or a reference to
  another reference, ultimately to a SHA-1 (no loops!)

To work with refs, we're first going to need a simple recursive solver
that will take a ref name, follow eventual recursive references (refs
whose content begin with =ref:=, as exemplified above) and return a
SHA-1 identifier:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def ref_resolve(repo, ref):
      path = repo_file(repo, ref)

      # Sometimes, an indirect reference may be broken.  This is normal
      # in one specific case: we're looking for HEAD on a new repository
      # with no commits.  In that case, .git/HEAD points to "ref:
      # refs/heads/main", but .git/refs/heads/main doesn't exist yet
      # (since there's no commit for it to refer to).
      if not os.path.isfile(path):
          return None

      with open(path, 'r') as fp:
          data = fp.read()[:-1]
          # Drop final \n ^^^^^
      if data.startswith("ref: "):
          return ref_resolve(repo, data[5:])
      else:
          return data
#+END_SRC

Let's create two small functions, and implement the =show-refs=
command --- it just lists all references in a repository.  First, a
stupid recursive function to collect refs and return them as a dict:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def ref_list(repo, path=None):
      if not path:
          path = repo_dir(repo, "refs")
      ret = collections.OrderedDict()
      # Git shows refs sorted.  To do the same, we use
      # an OrderedDict and sort the output of listdir
      for f in sorted(os.listdir(path)):
          can = os.path.join(path, f)
          if os.path.isdir(can):
              ret[f] = ref_list(repo, can)
          else:
              ret[f] = ref_resolve(repo, can)

      return ret
#+END_SRC

And, as usual, a subparser, a bridge, and a (recursive) worker function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("show-ref", help="List references.")

  def cmd_show_ref(args):
      repo = repo_find()
      refs = ref_list(repo)
      show_ref(repo, refs, prefix="refs")

  def show_ref(repo, refs, with_hash=True, prefix=""):
      for k, v in refs.items():
          if type(v) == str:
              print ("{0}{1}{2}".format(
                  v + " " if with_hash else "",
                  prefix + "/" if prefix else "",
                  k))
          else:
              show_ref(repo, v, with_hash=with_hash, prefix="{0}{1}{2}".format(prefix, "/" if prefix else "", k))
#+END_SRC

** Tags as references
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tags
:END:

The most simple use of refs is tags.  A tag is just a user-defined
name for an object, often a commit.  A very common use of tags is
identifying software releases: You've just merged the last commit of,
say, version 12.78.52 of your program, so your most recent commit
(let's call it =6071c08=) /is/ your version 12.78.52.  To make this
association explicit, all you have to do is:

#+BEGIN_src shell
  git tag v12.78.52 6071c08
  # the object hash ^here^^ is optional and defaults to HEAD.
#+END_SRC

This creates a new tag, called =v12.78.52=, pointing at =6071c08=.
Tagging is like aliasing: a tag introduces a new way to refer to an
existing object.  After the tag is created, the name =v12.78.52= refers
to =6071c08=.  For example, these two commands are now perfectly
equivalent:

#+BEGIN_src shell
  git checkout v12.78.52
  git checkout 6071c08
#+END_src

#+begin_note
  Versions are a common use of tags, but like almost everything in
  Git, tags have no predefined semantics: they mean whatever you want
  them to mean, and can point to whichever object you want, you can
  even tag /blobs/!
#+end_note

** Lightweight tags and tag objects, and parsing the latter
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: GitTag
:END:

You've probably guessed already that tags are actually refs.  They
live in the =.git/refs/tags/= hierarchy.  The only point worth noting is
that they come in two flavors: lightweight tags and tags objects.

- "Lightweight" tags :: are just regular refs to a commit, a tree or
     a blob.

- Tag objects :: are regular refs pointing to an object of type =tag=.
  Unlike lightweight tags, tag objects have an author, a date, an
  optional PGP signature and an optional annotation.  Their format is
  the same as a commit object.

We don't even need to implement tag objects, we can reuse =GitCommit=
and just change the =fmt= field:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
class GitTag(GitCommit):
    fmt = b'tag'
#+END_SRC

And now we support tags.

** The tag command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-tag
:END:

Let's add the =tag= command.  In Git, it does two things: it creates a
new tag or list existing tags (by default).  So you can invoke it with:

#+BEGIN_src shell
  git tag                  # List all tags
  git tag NAME [OBJECT]    # create a new *lightweight* tag NAME, pointing
                           # at HEAD (default) or OBJECT
  git tag -a NAME [OBJECT] # create a new tag *object* NAME, pointing at
                           # HEAD (default) or OBJECT
#+END_src

This translates to argparse as follows.  Notice we ignore the mutual
exclusion between =--list= and =[-a] name [object]=, which seems too
complicated for argparse.

# @FIXME This ignores the mutual exclusion
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser(
      "tag",
      help="List and create tags")

  argsp.add_argument("-a",
                     action="store_true",
                     dest="create_tag_object",
                     help="Whether to create a tag object")

  argsp.add_argument("name",
                     nargs="?",
                     help="The new tag's name")

  argsp.add_argument("object",
                     default="HEAD",
                     nargs="?",
                     help="The object the new tag will point to")
#+END_SRC

The =cmd_tag= function will dispatch behavior (list or create) depending
on whether or not =name= is provided.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
    def cmd_tag(args):
        repo = repo_find()

        if args.name:
            tag_create(repo,
                       args.name,
                       args.object,
                       type="object" if args.create_tag_object else "ref")
        else:
            refs = ref_list(repo)
            show_ref(repo, refs["tags"], with_hash=False)
#+END_SRC

And we just need one more function to actually create the tag:

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tag_create(repo, name, ref, create_tag_object=False):
      # get the GitObject from the object reference
      sha = object_find(repo, ref)

      if create_tag_object:
          # create tag object (commit)
          tag = GitTag(repo)
          tag.kvlm = collections.OrderedDict()
          tag.kvlm[b'object'] = sha.encode()
          tag.kvlm[b'type'] = b'commit'
          tag.kvlm[b'tag'] = name.encode()
          # Feel free to let the user give their name!
          # Notice you can fix this after commit, read on!
          tag.kvlm[b'tagger'] = b'Wyag <wyag@example.com>'
          # …and a tag message!
          tag.kvlm[None] = b"A tag generated by wyag, which won't let you customize the message!"
          tag_sha = object_write(tag)
          # create reference
          ref_create(repo, "tags/" + name, tag_sha)
      else:
          # create lightweight tag (ref)
          ref_create(repo, "tags/" + name, sha)

  def ref_create(repo, ref_name, sha):
      with open(repo_file(repo, "refs/" + ref_name), 'w') as fp:
          fp.write(sha + "\n")
#+end_src

** What's a branch?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: branches
:END:

Tags are done.  Now for another big chunk: branches.

It's time to address the elephant in the room: like most Git users,
wyag still doesn't have any idea what a branch is.  It currently
treats a repository as a bunch of disorganized objects, some of them
commits, and has no representation whatsoever of the fact that commits
are grouped in branches, and that at every point in time there's a
commit that's =HEAD=, /ie/, the *head* commit (or "tip") of the
*active* branch.

So, what's a branch?  The answer is actually surprisingly simple, but
it may also end up being simply surprising: *a branch is a reference
to a commit*.  You could even say that a branch is a kind of a name
for a commit.  In this regard, a branch is exactly the same thing as a
tag.  Tags are refs that live in =.git/refs/tags=, branches are refs
that live in =.git/refs/heads=.

There are, of course, differences between a branch and a tag:

1. Branches are references to a /commit/, tags can refer to any object;
2. Most importantly, the branch ref is updated at each commit.  This means
   that whenever you commit, Git actually does this:
   1. a new commit object is created, with the current branch's
      (commit!) ID as its parent;
   2. the commit object is hashed and stored;
   3. the branch ref is updated to refer to the new commit's hash.

That's all.

But what about the *current* branch?  It's actually even easier.  It's a
ref file outside of the =refs= hierarchy, in =.git/HEAD=, which is an
*indirect* ref (that is, it is of the form =ref: path/to/other/ref=, and
not a simple hash).

#+begin_note
  *Detached HEAD*

  When you just checkout a random commit, git will warn you it's in
  "detached HEAD state".  This means you're not on any branch anymore.
  In this case, =.git/HEAD= is a *direct* reference: it contains a
  SHA-1.
#+end_note

** Referring to objects: the =object_find= function
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: object_find
:END:

*** Resolving names

Remember when we've created [[placeholder-object_find][the stupid =object_find= function]] that would
take four arguments, return the second unmodified and ignore the other
three?  It's time to replace it by something more useful.  We're going
to implement a small, but usable, subset of the actual Git name
resolution algorithm.  The new =object_find()= will work in two steps:
first, given a name, it will return a complete sha-1 hash.  For
example, with =HEAD=, it will return the hash of the head commit of the
current branch, etc.  More precisely, this name resolution function
will work like this:

- If =name= is =HEAD=, it will just resolve =.git/HEAD=;
- If =name= is a full hash, this hash is returned unmodified.
- If =name= looks like a short hash, it will collect objects whose full
  hash begin with this short hash.
- At last, it will resolve tags and branches matching name.

Notice how the last two steps /collect/ values: the first two are
absolute references, so we can safely return a result.  But short
hashes or branch names can be ambiguous, we want to enumerate all
possible meanings of the name and raise an error if we've found more
than 1.

#+begin_info
  *Short hashes*

  For convenience, Git allows to refer to hashes by a prefix of their
  name.  For example, =5bd254aa973646fa16f66d702a5826ea14a3eb45= can
  be referred to as =5bd254=.  This is called a "short hash".
#+end_info

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def object_resolve(repo, name):
      """Resolve name to an object hash in repo.

  This function is aware of:

   - the HEAD literal

      candidates = list()
      hashRE = re.compile(r"^[0-9A-Fa-f]{4,40}$")

      # Empty string?  Abort.
      if not name.strip():
          return None

      # Head is nonambiguous
      if name == "HEAD":
          return [ ref_resolve(repo, "HEAD") ]

      # If it's a hex string, try for a hash.
      if hashRE.match(name):
          # This may be a hash, either small or full.  4 seems to be the
          # minimal length for git to consider something a short hash.
          # This limit is documented in man git-rev-parse
          name = name.lower()
          prefix = name[0:2]
          path = repo_dir(repo, "objects", prefix, mkdir=False)
          if path:
              rem = name[2:]
              for f in os.listdir(path):
                  if f.startswith(rem):
                      # Notice a string startswith() itself, so this
                      # works for full hashes.
                      candidates.append(prefix + f)

      # Try for references.
      as_tag = ref_resolve(repo, "refs/tags/" + name)
      if as_tag: # Did we find a tag?
          candidates.append(as_tag)

      as_branch = ref_resolve(repo, "refs/heads/" + name)
      if as_branch: # Did we find a branch?
          candidates.append(as_branch)

      return candidates
#+END_SRC

The second step is to follow the object we found to an object of the
required type, if a type argument was provided.  Since we only need to
handle trivial cases, this is a very simple iterative process:

- If we have a tag and =fmt= is anything else, we follow the tag.
- If we have a commit and =fmt= is tree, we return this commit's tree
  object
- In all other situations, we bail out: nothing else makes sense.

(The process is iterative because it may take an undefined number of
steps, since tags themselves can be tagged)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def object_find(repo, name, fmt=None, follow=True):
        sha = object_resolve(repo, name)

        if not sha:
            raise Exception("No such reference {0}.".format(name))

        if len(sha) > 1:
            raise Exception("Ambiguous reference {0}: Candidates are:\n - {1}.".format(name,  "\n - ".join(sha)))

        sha = sha[0]

        if not fmt:
            return sha

        while True:
            obj = object_read(repo, sha)
            #     ^^^^^^^^^^^ < this is a bit agressive: we're reading
            # the full object just to get its type.  And we're doing
            # that in a loop, albeit normally short.  Don't expect
            # high performance here.

            if obj.fmt == fmt:
                return sha

            if not follow:
                return None

            # Follow tags
            if obj.fmt == b'tag':
                  sha = obj.kvlm[b'object'].decode("ascii")
            elif obj.fmt == b'commit' and fmt == b'tree':
                  sha = obj.kvlm[b'tree'].decode("ascii")
            else:
                return None
#+END_SRC

With the new =object_find()=, the CLI wyag becomes a bit more usable.  You can now do things like:

#+begin_example
$ wyag checkout v3.11 # A tag
$ wyag checkout feature/explosions # A branch
$ wyag ls-tree -r HEAD # The active branch or commit.  There's also a
                       # follow here: HEAD is actually a commit.
$ wyag cat-file blob e0695f # A short hash
$ wyag cat-file tree master # A branch, as a tree (another "follow")
#+end_example

*** The rev-parse command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-rev-parse
:END:

Let's implement =wyag rev-parse=.  The =git rev-parse= commands does a
lot, but one of its use cases, the one we're going to clone, is
solving references.  For the purpose of further testing the "follow"
feature of =object_find=, we'll add an optional =wyag-type= argument
to its interface.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser(
      "rev-parse",
      help="Parse revision (or other objects) identifiers")

  argsp.add_argument("--wyag-type",
                     metavar="type",
                     dest="type",
                     choices=["blob", "commit", "tag", "tree"],
                     default=None,
                     help="Specify the expected type")

  argsp.add_argument("name",
                     help="The name to parse")
#+END_SRC

The bridge does all the job:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_rev_parse(args):
      if args.type:
          fmt = args.type.encode()
      else:
          fmt = None

      repo = repo_find()

      print (object_find(repo, args.name, fmt, follow=True))
#+END_SRC

And it works:

#+begin_example
$ wyag rev-parse --wyag-type commit HEAD
6c22393f5e3830d15395fd8d2f8b0cf8eb40dd58
$ wyag rev-parse --wyag-type tree HEAD

* Working with the staging area and the index file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: staging-area
:END:

** What's the index file?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: staging-intro
:END:

This final step will bring us to where commits happen (although
actually creating them is for the next section!)

You probably know that to commit in Git, you first "stage" some
changes, using =git add= and =git rm=, and only /then/ do you commit
those changes.  This intermediate stage between the last and the next
commit is called the *staging area*.

It would seem natural to use a commit or tree object to represent the
staging area, but Git actually and uses a completely different
mechanism, in the form of what it calls the *index file*.

After a commit, the index file is a sort of copy of that commit: it
holds the same path/blob association than the corresponding tree.  But
it also holds extra information about files in the worktree, like
their creation/modification time, so =git status= doesn't often need
to actually compare files: it just checks that their modification time
is the same as the one stored in the index file, and only if it isn't
does it perform an actual comparison.

You can thus consider the index file as a three-way association list:
not only paths with blobs, but also paths with actual filesystem
entries.

Another important characteristic of the *index file* is that unlike a
tree, it can represent inconsistent states, like a merge conflict,
whereas a tree is always a complete, unambiguous representation.

When you commit, what git actually does is turn the index file into a
new tree object.  To summarize:

 1. When the repository is “clean”, the index file holds the exact
    same contents as the HEAD commit, plus metadata about the
    corresponding filesystem entries.  For instance, it may contain
    something like:

    #+begin_quote
    There's a file called =src/disp.c= whose contents are blob
    797441c76e59e28794458b39b0f1eff4c85f4fa0.  The real =src/disp.c=
    file, in the worktree, was created on 2023-07-15
    15:28:29.168572151, and last modified 2023-07-15
    15:28:29.1689427709.  It is stored on device 65026, inode 8922881.
    #+end_quote

 2. When you =git add= or =git rm=, the index file is modified
    accordingly.  In the example above, if you modify =src/disp.c=,
    and =add= your changes, the index file will be updated with a new
    blob ID (the blob itself will also be created in the process, of
    course), and the various file metadata will be updated as well so
    =git status= knows when not to compare file contents.

 3. When you =git commit= those changes, a new tree is produced from
    the index file, a new commit object is generated with that tree,
    branches are updated and we're done.

#+begin_note
  *A note on words*

  The staging area and the index are thus the same thing, but the name
  "staging area" is more the name of the git user-exposed feature
  (that could have been implemented otherwise), the abstraction if you
  will; while "index file" refers specifically to the way this
  abstract feature is actually implemented in git.
#+end_note

** Parsing the index
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: index_read
:END:

The index file is by far the most complicated piece of data a Git
repository can hold.  Its complete documentation can be found in Git
source tree at =Documentation/gitformat-index.txt=; you can browse it [[https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitformat-index.txt][on
the Github mirror]].  It's made of three parts:

  - An header with the format version number and the number of entries
    the index holds;
  - A series of entries, sorted, each representing a file; padded to
    multiple of 8 bytes.
  - A series of optional extensions, which we'll ignore.
# @FIXME ^ Sorted how? Do we need to think about this?

The first thing we need to represent is a single entry.  It actually
holds quite a lot of stuff, I'm leaving the details in comments.
It's worth observing that an entry stores *both* the SHA-1 of the
associated blob in the object store /and/ a ton of metadata about the
actual file on the actual filesystem.  Again, this is because
=git/wyag status= will need to determine which files in the index were
modified: it is much more efficient to begin by checking the
last-modified timestamp and comparing it with a known values, before
comparing actual files.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitIndexEntry (object):
      def __init__(self, ctime=None, mtime=None, dev=None, ino=None,
                   mode_type=None, mode_perms=None, uid=None, gid=None,
                   fsize=None, sha=None, flag_assume_valid=None,
                   flag_stage=None, name=None):
        # The last time a file's metadata changed.  This is a pair
        # (timestamp in seconds, nanoseconds)
        self.ctime = ctime
        # The last time a file's data changed.  This is a pair
        # (timestamp in seconds, nanoseconds)
        self.mtime = mtime
        # The ID of device containing this file
        self.dev = dev
        # The file's inode number
        self.ino = ino
        # The object type, either b1000 (regular), b1010 (symlink),
        # b1110 (gitlink).
        self.mode_type = mode_type
        # The object permissions, an integer.
        self.mode_perms = mode_perms
        # User ID of owner
        self.uid = uid
        # Group ID of ownner
        self.gid = gid
        # Size of this object, in bytes
        self.fsize = fsize
        # The object's SHA
        self.sha = sha
        self.flag_assume_valid = flag_assume_valid
        self.flag_stage = flag_stage
        # Name of the object (full path this time!)
        self.name = name
#+end_src

The index file is a binary file, likely for performance reasons.  The
format is reasonably simple, though.  It begins with a header with the
=DIRC= magic bytes, a version number and the total number of entries
in that index file.  We create the =GitIndex= class to hold them:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitIndex (object):

#+END_SRC

And a parser to read index files into those objects.  After reading
the 12-bytes header, we just parse entries in the order they appear.
An entry begins with a set of fixed-length data, followed by a
variable-length name.

The code is quite straightforward, but as it's reading a binary
format, it feels more messy than what we did so far.  We use the
=int.from_bytes(bytes, endianness)= a lot to read raw bytes into an
integer, and just a few bitwise operations to separate data
that share the same byte.

(This format was probably designed so index files could just be
=mmapp()ed= to memory, and read directly as C structs, with an index
built in O(n) time in most cases.  This kind of approach tends to
produce more elegant code in C than in Python…)

#+END_SRC

If you run ls-tree, you'll notice that on a “clean” worktree (an
unmodified checkout of =HEAD=), it lists all files on =HEAD=.  Again,
the index is not a /delta/ (a set of differences) from the =HEAD=
commit, but starts as a copy of it, in a different format.

** A detour: the check-ignore command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-check-ignore
:END:

We want to write =status=, but =status= needs to know about ignore
rules, that are stored in the various =.gitignore= files.  So we first
need to add some rudimentary support for ignore files in =wyag=.
We'll expose this support as the =check-ignore= command, which takes a
list of paths and outputs back those of those paths that should be
ignored.

Again, the command parser is trivial:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("check-ignore", help = "Check path(s) against ignore rules.")
  argsp.add_argument("path", nargs="+", help="Paths to check")
#+END_src

And the function is just as simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_check_ignore(args):
    repo = repo_find()
    rules = gitignore_read(repo)
    for path in args.path:
        if check_ignore(rules, path):
          print(path)
#+END_src

But of course, most of the function we call don't exist yet in wyag.
We'll begin by writing a reader for rules in ignore files,
=gitignore_read()=.  The syntax of those rules is quite simple: each
line in an ignore file is an exclusion pattern, so files that match
this pattern are ignored by =status=, =add -A= and so on.  There are
three special cases, though:

 1. Lines that begin with an exclamation mark =!= /negate/ the pattern
    (files that match this pattern are /included/, even they were
    ignored by an earlier pattern)
 2. Lines that begin with a dash =#= are comments, and are skipped.
 2. A backslash =\= at the beginning treats =!= and =#= as literal
    characters.

First, a parser for a single pattern. This parser returns a pair: the
pattern itself, and a boolean to indicate if files matching the
pattern /should/ be excluded (=True=) or included (=False=).  In other
words, =False= if the pattern did start with =!=, =True= otherwise.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def gitignore_parse1(raw):
      raw = raw.strip() # Remove leading/trailing spaces

      if not raw or raw[0] == "#":
          return None
      elif raw[0] == "!":
          return (raw[1:], False)
      elif raw[0] == "\\":
          return (raw[1:], True)
      else:
          return (raw, True)
#+end_src

Parsing a file is just collecting all rules in that file.  Notice this
function doesn't parse /files/, but just lists of lines: that's
because we'll need to read rules from git blobs as well, and not just
regular files.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def gitignore_parse(lines):
      ret = list()

      for line in lines:
          parsed = gitignore_parse1(line)
          if parsed:
              ret.append(parsed)

      return ret
#+end_src

Last thing we need to do is collect the various ignore files.  They
come in two kinds:

 - Some of these files *live in the index*: they're the various
   =gitignore= files.  Emphasis on the plural; although there often is
   only one such file, at the root, there can be one in each
   directory, and it applies to this directory and its subdirectories.
   I'll call those *scoped*, because they only apply to paths under
   their directory.
 - The others live *outside the index*.  They're the global ignore
   file (usually in =~/.config/git/ignore=) and the
   repository-specific =.git/info/exclude=.  I call those *absolute*,
   because they apply everywhere, but at a lower priority.

Again, a class to hold that: a list of absolute rules, a dict
(hashmap) of relative rules.  The keys to this hashmap are
*directories*, relative to the root of a worktree.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  class GitIgnore(object):
      absolute = None
      scoped = None

      def __init__(self, absolute, scoped):
          self.absolute = absolute
          self.scoped = scoped
#+end_src

And finally our function to collect all gitignore rules in a
repository, and return a =GitIgnore= object.  Notice how it reads
scoped files from the index, and not the worktree: only /staged/
=.gitignore= files matter (also remember: HEAD is /already/ staged ---
the staging area is a copy, not a delta).

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def gitignore_read(repo):
      ret = GitIgnore(absolute=list(), scoped=dict())

      # Read local configuration in .git/info/exclude
      repo_file = os.path.join(repo.gitdir, "info/exclude")
      if os.path.exists(repo_file):
          with open(repo_file, "r") as f:
              ret.absolute.append(gitignore_parse(f.readlines()))

      # Global configuration
      if "XDG_CONFIG_HOME" in os.environ:
          config_home = os.environ["XDG_CONFIG_HOME"]
      else:
          config_home = os.path.expanduser("~/.config")
      global_file = os.path.join(config_home, "git/ignore")

      if os.path.exists(global_file):
          with open(global_file, "r") as f:
              ret.absolute.append(gitignore_parse(f.readlines()))

      # .gitignore files in the index
      index = index_read(repo)

      for entry in index.entries:
          if entry.name == ".gitignore" or entry.name.endswith("/.gitignore"):
              dir_name = os.path.dirname(entry.name)
              contents = object_read(repo, entry.sha)
              lines = contents.blobdata.decode("utf8").splitlines()
              ret.scoped[dir_name] = gitignore_parse(lines)
      return ret
#+end_src

We're almost there.  To tie everything together, we need the
=check_ignore= function that matches a path, relative to the root of a
worktree, against a set of rules.  This is how this function will
work:

 - It will first try to match this path against the *scoped* rules.
   It will do this from the deepest parent of the path to the
   farthest.  That is, if the path is
   =src/support/w32/legacy/sound.c~=, it will first look for rules in
   =src/support/w32/legacy/.gitignore=, then
   =src/support/w32/.gitignore=, =src/support/.gitignore=, and so on
   up to simply =.gitignore"= at the root.
 - If nothing matches, it will continue with the *absolute* rules.

We write three small support functions.  One to match a path against a
set of rules, and return the result of the last matching rule.  Notice
how it's not a real boolean functions, since it has *three* possible
return values: =True=, =False= but also =None=.  It returns =None= if
nothing matched, so the caller knows it should continue trying with
more general ignore files (eg, go one directory level up).

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def check_ignore1(rules, path):
      result = None
      for (pattern, value) in rules:
          if fnmatch(path, pattern):
              result = value
      return result
#+end_src

A function to match against the dictionary of *scoped* rules (the
various =.gitignore= files).  It just starts at the path's directory
then moves up to the parent directory, recursively, until it has
tested root.  Notice that this function (and the next two as well),
never breaks *inside* a given =.gitignore= file.  Even if a rule
matches, they keep going through the file, because another rule there
may negate reverse the effect (rules are processed in order, so if you
want to exclude =*.c= but not =generator.c=, the general rule must
come before the specific one).  But as soon as at least one rule
matched in a file, we drop the remaining files, because a more general
file never cancels the effect of a more specific one (this is why
=check_ignore1= is ternary and not boolean)

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def check_ignore_scoped(rules, path):
      parent = os.path.dirname(path)
      while True:
          if parent in rules:
              result = check_ignore1(rules[parent], path)
              if result != None:
                  return result
          if parent == "":
              break
          parent = os.path.dirname(parent)
      return None
#+end_src

A much simpler function to match against the list of absolute rules.
Notice that the order we push those rules to the list matters (we
/did/ read the repository rules before the global ones!)

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def check_ignore_absolute(rules, path):
      parent = os.path.dirname(path)
      for ruleset in rules:
          result = check_ignore1(ruleset, path)
          if result != None:
              return result
      return False # This is a reasonable default at this point.
#+end_src

And finally, a function to bind them all.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def check_ignore(rules, path):
      if os.path.isabs(path):
          raise Exception("This function requires path to be relative to the repository's root")

      result = check_ignore_scoped(rules.scoped, path)
      if result != None:
          return result

      return check_ignore_absolute(rules.absolute, path)
#+end_src

You can now call =wyag check-ignore=.  On its own source tree:

#+begin_example
  $ wyag check-ignore hello.el hello.elc hello.html wyag.zip wyag.tar
  hello.elc
  hello.html
  wyag.zip
#+end_example

#+begin_warning
  *This is only an approximation*

  This isn't a perfect reimplementation.  In particular, excluding
  whole directories with a rule that's only the directory name (eg
  =__pycache__=) won't work, because =fnmatch= would want the pattern
  as =__pycache__/**=.  If you really want to play with ignore rules,
  [[https://github.com/mherrmann/gitignore_parser][this may be a good
  starting point]].
#+end_warning

** The status command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-status
:END:

=status= is more complex than =ls-files=, because it needs to compare
the index with both HEAD /and/ the actual filesystem.  You call =git
status= to know which files were added, removed or modified since the
last commit, and which of these changes are actually staged, and will
make it to the next commit.  So =status= actually compares the =HEAD=
with the staging area, and the staging area with the worktree.  This
is what its output looks like:

#+begin_example
On branch master

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   write-yourself-a-git.org

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   write-yourself-a-git.org

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	org-html-themes/
	wl-copy
#+end_example

We'll implement =status= in three parts: first the active branch or
“detached HEAD”, then the difference between the index and the
worktree (“Changes not staged for commit”), then the difference
between HEAD and the index (“Changes to be committed” and “Untracked
files”).

The public interface is dead simple, our status will take no argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("status", help = "Show the working tree status.")
#+END_src

And the bridge function just calls the three component functions in order:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_status(_):
      repo = repo_find()
      index = index_read(repo)

      cmd_status_branch(repo)
      cmd_status_head_index(repo, index)
      print()
      cmd_status_index_worktree(repo, index)
#+END_src

*** Finding the active branch

First we need to know if we're on a branch, and if so which one.  We
do this by just looking at =.git/HEAD=.  It should contain either an
hexadecimal ID (a ref to a commit, in detached HEAD state), or an
indirect reference to something in =refs/heads/=: the active branch.
We either return its name, or =False=.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def branch_get_active(repo):
      with open(repo_file(repo, "HEAD"), "r") as f:
          head = f.read()

      if head.startswith("ref: refs/heads/"):
          return(head[16:-1])
      else:
          return False
#+end_src

Based on this, we can write the first of the three =cmd_status_*=
functions the bridge calls.  This one prints the name of the active
branch, or the hash of the detached HEAD:

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_status_branch(repo):
      branch = branch_get_active(repo)
      if branch:
          print("On branch {}.".format(branch))
      else:
          print("HEAD detached at {}".format (object_find(repo, "HEAD")))
#+end_src

*** Finding changes between HEAD and index

The second block of the status output is the “changes to be
committed”, that is, how the staging area differs from HEAD.  To do
this, we're going first to read the =HEAD= tree, and flatten it as a
single dict (hashmap) with full paths as keys, so it's closer to the
(flat) index associating paths to blobs.  Then we'll just compare
them and output their differences.

First, a function to convert a tree (recursive, remember) to a (flat)
dict.  And since trees are recursive, so the function itself is, again ---
sorry about that :)

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tree_to_dict(repo, ref, prefix=""):
    ret = dict()
    tree_sha = object_find(repo, ref, fmt=b"tree")
    tree = object_read(repo, tree_sha)

    for leaf in tree.items:
        full_path = os.path.join(prefix, leaf.path)

        # We read the object to extract its type (this is uselessly
        # expensive: we could just open it as a file and read the
        # first few bytes)
        is_subtree = leaf.mode.startswith(b'04')

        # Depending on the type, we either store the path (if it's a
        # blob, so a regular file), or recurse (if it's another tree,
        # so a subdir)
        if is_subtree:
          ret.update(tree_to_dict(repo, leaf.sha, full_path))
        else:
          ret[full_path] = leaf.sha

    return ret
#+end_src

And the command itself:

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_status_head_index(repo, index):
      print("Changes to be committed:")

      head = tree_to_dict(repo, "HEAD")
      for entry in index.entries:
          if entry.name in head:
              if head[entry.name] != entry.sha:
                  print("  modified:", entry.name)
              del head[entry.name] # Delete the key
          else:
              print("  added:   ", entry.name)

      # Keys still in HEAD are files that we haven't met in the index,
      # and thus have been deleted.
      for entry in head.keys():
          print("  deleted: ", entry)
#+end_src

*** Finding changes between index and worktree

  def cmd_status_index_worktree(repo, index):
      print("Changes not staged for commit:")

      ignore = gitignore_read(repo)

      gitdir_prefix = repo.gitdir + os.path.sep

      all_files = list()

      # We begin by walking the filesystem
      for (root, _, files) in os.walk(repo.worktree, True):
          if root==repo.gitdir or root.startswith(gitdir_prefix):
              continue
          for f in files:
              full_path = os.path.join(root, f)
              rel_path = os.path.relpath(full_path, repo.worktree)
              all_files.append(rel_path)

      # We now traverse the index, and compare real files with the cached
      # versions.

      for entry in index.entries:
          full_path = os.path.join(repo.worktree, entry.name)

          else:

              # Compare metadata
              ctime_ns = entry.ctime[0] * 10**9 + entry.ctime[1]
              mtime_ns = entry.mtime[0] * 10**9 + entry.mtime[1]
              if (stat.st_ctime_ns != ctime_ns) or (stat.st_mtime_ns != mtime_ns):
                  # If different, deep compare.
                  # @FIXME This *will* crash on symlinks to dir.
                  with open(full_path, "rb") as fd:
                      new_sha = object_hash(fd, b"blob", None)
                      # If the hashes are the same, the files are actually the same.
                      same = entry.sha == new_sha

                      if not same:
                          print("  modified:", entry.name)

          if entry.name in all_files:
              all_files.remove(entry.name)

      print()
      print("Untracked files:")

      for f in all_files:
          # @TODO If a full directory is untracked, we should display
          # its name without its contents.
          if not check_ignore(ignore, f):
              print(" ", f)
#+end_src

Our status function is done.  It should output something like:

#+begin_example
$ wyag status
On branch main.
Changes to be committed:
  added:    src/main.c

Changes not staged for commit:
  modified: build.py
  deleted:  README.org

Untracked files:
  src/cli.c
#+end_example

The real =status= is a lot smarter: it can detect renames, for
example, where ours cannot.  Another significant difference worth
mentioning is that =git status= actually /writes/ the index back if a
file metadata was modified, but not its content.  You can see it with
our special ls-files:

  #+begin_example
  $ wyag ls-files --verbose
  Index file format v2, containing 1 entries.
  file
    regular file with perms: 644
    on blob: f2f279981ce01b095c42ee7162aadf60185c8f67
    created: 2023-07-18 18:26:15.771460869, modified: 2023-07-18 18:26:15.771460869
    ...
  $ touch file
  $ git status > /dev/null
  $ wyag ls-files --verbose
  Index file format v2, containing 1 entries.
  file
    regular file with perms: 644
    on blob: f2f279981ce01b095c42ee7162aadf60185c8f67

    ...
  #+end_example

Notice how both timestamps, from the /index file/, were updated by
=git status= to reflect the changes in the real file's metadata.

* Staging area and index, part 2: staging and committing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: committing
:END:

OK.  Let's create commits.

We have /almost/ everything we need for that, except for three last
things:

 1. We need commands to modify the index, so our commits aren't just a
    copy of their parent.  Those commands are =add= and =rm=.
 2. These commands need to write the modified index back, since we
    commit /from the index/.
 3. And obviously, we'll need the =commit= function and its associated
    =wyag commit= command.

** Writing the index
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: index_write
:END:

We'll start by writing the index.  Roughly, we're just serializing
everything back to binary.  This is a bit tedious, but the code should
be straightforward.  I'm leaving the gory details for the comments,
but it's really just =index_read= in reverse --- refer to it if
needed, and the =GitIndexEntry= class.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def index_write(repo, index):
      with open(repo_file(repo, "index"), "wb") as f:

          # HEADER

          # Write the magic bytes.
          f.write(b"DIRC")
          # Write version number.
          f.write(index.version.to_bytes(4, "big"))
          # Write the number of entries.
          f.write(len(index.entries).to_bytes(4, "big"))

          # ENTRIES

          idx = 0
          for e in index.entries:
              f.write(e.ctime[0].to_bytes(4, "big"))
              f.write(e.ctime[1].to_bytes(4, "big"))
              f.write(e.mtime[0].to_bytes(4, "big"))
              f.write(e.mtime[1].to_bytes(4, "big"))
              f.write(e.dev.to_bytes(4, "big"))
              f.write(e.ino.to_bytes(4, "big"))

              # Mode
              mode = (e.mode_type << 12) | e.mode_perms
              f.write(mode.to_bytes(4, "big"))

              f.write(e.uid.to_bytes(4, "big"))
              f.write(e.gid.to_bytes(4, "big"))

              f.write(e.fsize.to_bytes(4, "big"))
              # @FIXME Convert back to int.
              f.write(int(e.sha, 16).to_bytes(20, "big"))

              flag_assume_valid = 0x1 << 15 if e.flag_assume_valid else 0

              name_bytes = e.name.encode("utf8")
              bytes_len = len(name_bytes)
              if bytes_len >= 0xFFF:
                  name_length = 0xFFF
              else:
                  name_length = bytes_len

              # We merge back three pieces of data (two flags and the
              # length of the name) on the same two bytes.
              f.write((flag_assume_valid | e.flag_stage | name_length).to_bytes(2, "big"))

              # Write back the name, and a final 0x00.
              f.write(name_bytes)
              f.write((0).to_bytes(1, "big"))

              idx += 62 + len(name_bytes) + 1

              # Add padding if necessary.
              if idx % 8 != 0:
                  pad = 8 - (idx % 8)
                  f.write((0).to_bytes(pad, "big"))
                  idx += pad
#+end_src

** The rm command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-rm
:END:

The easiest change we can do to an index is to remove an entry from
it, which mean that the next commit *won't include* this file.  This
is what the =git rm= command does.

#+BEGIN_danger
  =git rm= is *destructive*, and so is =wyag rm=.  The command not
  only modifies the index, it also removes file(s) from the worktree.
  Unlike git, =wyag rm= doesn't care if the file it removes isn't
  saved.  Proceed with caution.
#+END_danger

=rm= takes a single argument, a list of paths to remove:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("rm", help="Remove files from the working tree and the index.")
  argsp.add_argument("path", nargs="+", help="Files to remove")

  def cmd_rm(args):
    repo = repo_find()
    rm(repo, args.path)
#+END_src

The =rm= function is a bit long, but it's very simple.  It takes a
repository and a list of paths, reads that repository index, and
removes entries in the index that match this list.  The optional
arguments control whether the function should actually delete the
files, and whether it should abort if some paths aren't present on the
index (both those arguments are for the use of =add=, they're not
exposed in the =wyag rm= command).

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def rm(repo, paths, delete=True, skip_missing=False):
    # Find and read the index
    index = index_read(repo)

    worktree = repo.worktree + os.sep

    # Make paths absolute
    abspaths = list()
    for path in paths:
      abspath = os.path.abspath(path)
      if abspath.startswith(worktree):
        abspaths.append(abspath)
      else:
        raise Exception("Cannot remove paths outside of worktree: {}".format(paths))

    kept_entries = list()
    remove = list()

    for e in index.entries:
      full_path = os.path.join(repo.worktree, e.name)

      if full_path in abspaths:
        remove.append(full_path)
        abspaths.remove(full_path)
      else:
        kept_entries.append(e) # Preserve entry

    if len(abspaths) > 0 and not skip_missing:
      raise Exception("Cannot remove paths not in the index: {}".format(abspaths))

    if delete:
      for path in remove:
        os.unlink(path)

    index.entries = kept_entries
    index_write(repo, index)
#+END_SRC

And we can now delete files with =wyag rm=.

** The add command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-add
:END:

Adding is just a bit more complex than removing, but nothing we don't
already know.  Staging a file to a three-steps operation:

 1. We begin by removing the existing index entry, if there's one,
    without removing the file itself (this is why the =rm= function we
    just wrote has those optional arguments).
 2. We then hash the file into a glob object,
 3. create its entry,
 4. And of course, finally write the modified index back.

First, the interface.  Nothing surprising, =wyag add PATH ...= where
PATH is one or more file(s) to stage.  The bridge is as boring as can be.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("add", help = "Add files contents to the index.")
  argsp.add_argument("path", nargs="+", help="Files to add")

  def cmd_add(args):
    repo = repo_find()
    add(repo, args.path)
#+END_src

The main difference with =rm= is that =add= needs to create an index
entry.  This isn't hard: we just =stat()= the file and copy the
metadata in the index's field (=stat()= returns those metadata the
index stores: creation/modification time, and so on)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle libwyag.py
  def add(repo, paths, delete=True, skip_missing=False):

    # First remove all paths from the index, if they exist.
    rm (repo, paths, delete=False, skip_missing=True)

    worktree = repo.worktree + os.sep

    # Convert the paths to pairs: (absolute, relative_to_worktree).
    # Also delete them from the index if they're present.
    clean_paths = list()
    for path in paths:
      abspath = os.path.abspath(path)
      if not (abspath.startswith(worktree) and os.path.isfile(abspath)):
        raise Exception("Not a file, or outside the worktree: {}".format(paths))
      relpath = os.path.relpath(abspath, repo.worktree)
      clean_paths.append((abspath,  relpath))

      # Find and read the index.  It was modified by rm.  (This isn't
      # optimal, good enough for wyag!)
      #
      # @FIXME, though: we could just
      # move the index through commands instead of reading and writing
      # it over again.
      index = index_read(repo)

      for (abspath, relpath) in clean_paths:
        with open(abspath, "rb") as fd:
          sha = object_hash(fd, b"blob", repo)

        stat = os.stat(abspath)

        ctime_s = int(stat.st_ctime)
        ctime_ns = stat.st_ctime_ns % 10**9
        mtime_s = int(stat.st_mtime)
        mtime_ns = stat.st_mtime_ns % 10**9

        entry = GitIndexEntry(ctime=(ctime_s, ctime_ns), mtime=(mtime_s, mtime_ns), dev=stat.st_dev, ino=stat.st_ino,
                              mode_type=0b1000, mode_perms=0o644, uid=stat.st_uid, gid=stat.st_gid,
                              fsize=stat.st_size, sha=sha, flag_assume_valid=False,
                              flag_stage=False, name=relpath)
        index.entries.append(entry)

      # Write the index back
      index_write(repo, index)
#+END_SRC

** The commit command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmd-commit
:END:

Now that we have modified the index, so actually /staged changes/, we
only need to turn those changes into a commit.  That's what =commit= does.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser("commit", help="Record changes to the repository.")

  argsp.add_argument("-m",
                     metavar="message",
                     dest="message",
                     help="Message to associate with this commit.")
#+end_src

To do so, we first need to convert the index into a tree object,
generate and store the corresponding commit object, and update the
HEAD branch to the new commit (remember: a branch is just a ref to a
commit).

Before we get to the interesting details, we will need to read git's
config to get the name of the user, which we'll use as the author and
committer.  We'll use the same =configparser= library we've used to
read repo's config.

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def gitconfig_read():
      xdg_config_home = os.environ["XDG_CONFIG_HOME"] if "XDG_CONFIG_HOME" in os.environ else "~/.config"
      configfiles = [
          os.path.expanduser(os.path.join(xdg_config_home, "git/config")),
          os.path.expanduser("~/.gitconfig")
      ]

      config = configparser.ConfigParser()
      config.read(configfiles)
      return config
#+end_src

And just a simple function to grab, and format, the user identity:

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def gitconfig_user_get(config):
      if "user" in config:
          if "name" in config["user"] and "email" in config["user"]:
              return "{} <{}>".format(config["user"]["name"], config["user"]["email"])
      return None
#+end_src

Now for the interesting part.  We first need to build a tree from the
index.  This isn't hard, but notice that while the index is flat (it
stores full paths for the whole worktree), a tree is a recursive
structure: it lists files, or other trees.  To "unflatten" the index
into a tree, we're going to:

 1. Build a dictionary (hashmap) of directories.  Keys are full paths
    from worktree root (like =assets/sprites/monsters/=), values are
    list of =GitIndexEntry= --- files in the directory.  At this point, our
    dictionary only contains /files/: directories are only its keys.
 2. Traverse this list, going bottom-up, that is, from the deepest
    directories up to root (depth doesn't really matter: we just want
    to see each directory /before/ its parent.  To do that, we just
    sort them by /full/ path length, from longest to shortest ---
    parents are obviously always shorter).  As an example, imagine we
    start at =assets/sprites/monsters/=
 3. At each directory, we build a tree with its contents, say
    =cacodemon.png=, =imp.png= and =baron-of-hell.png=.
 4. We write the new tree to the repository.
 5. We then add this tree to this directory's parent.  Meaning that at
    this point, =assets/sprites/= now contains our new tree object's
    SHA-1 id under the name =monsters=.
 6. And we iterate over the next directory, let's say
    =assets/sprites/keys= where we find =red.png=, =blue.png= and
    =yellow.png=, create a tree, store the tree, add the tree's SHA-1
    under the name =keys= under =assets/sprites/=, and so on.

And since trees are recursive?  So the last tree we'll build, which is
necessarily the one for root (since its key's length is 0), will
ultimately refer to all others, and thus will be only one we'll need.
We'll simply return its SHA-1, and be done.

Since this may seem a bit complex, let's work this example in full
details --- feel free to skip.  At the beginning, the dictionary we
built from the index looks like this:

#+begin_example
  contents["assets/sprites/monsters"] =
    [ cacodemon.png : GitIndexEntry
    , imp.png : GitIndexEntry
    , baron-of-hell.png : GitIndexEntry ]
  contents["assets/sprites/keys"] =
    [ red.png : GitIndexEntry
    , blue.png : GitIndexEntry
    , yellow.png : GitIndexEntry ]
  contents["assets/sprites/"] =
    [ hero.png : GitIndexEntry ]
  contents["assets/"] = [] # No files in here
  contents[""] = # Root!
    [ README: GitIndexEntry ]
#+end_example

We iterate over it, by order of descending key length.  The first key
we meet is the longest, so =assets/sprites/monsters=.  We build a new
tree object from its contents, which associates the three file names
(=cacodemon.png=, =imp.png=, =baron-of-hell.png=) with their
corresponding blobs (A tree leaf stores /less/ data than the index ---
just path, mode and blob.  So converting entries that way is easy)

Notice we don't need to concern ourselves with storing the *contents*
of those files: =wyag add= did create the corresponding blobs as
needed.  We need to store the /trees/ we create to the object store,
but we can assume the blobs are there already.

Let's say that our new tree hashes, made from the index entries that
lived directly in =assets/sprites/monsters=, hashes down to
=426f894781bc3c38f1d26f8fd2c7f38ab8d21763=.  We *modify our
dictionary* to add that new tree object to the directory's parent,
like this, so what remains to traverse now looks like this:

#+begin_example
  contents["assets/sprites/keys"] = # <- unmodified.
    [ red.png : GitIndexEntry
    , blue.png : GitIndexEntry
    , yellow.png : GitIndexEntry ]
  contents["assets/sprites/"] =
    [ hero.png : GitIndexEntry
    , monsters : Tree 426f894781bc3c38f1d26f8fd2c7f38ab8d21763 ] <- look here
  contents["assets/"] = [] # empty
  contents[""] = # Root!
    [ README: GitIndexEntry ]
#+end_example

We do the same for the next longest key, =assets/sprites/keys=,
producing a tree of hash =b42788e087b1e94a0e69dcb7a4a243eaab802bb2=,
so:

#+begin_example
  contents["assets/sprites/"] =
    [ hero.png : GitIndexEntry
    ,  monsters : Tree 426f894781bc3c38f1d26f8fd2c7f38ab8d21763
    , keys : Tree b42788e087b1e94a0e69dcb7a4a243eaab802bb2 ]
  contents["assets/"] = [] # empty
  contents[""] = # Root!
    [ README: GitIndexEntry ]
#+end_example

We then generate tree =6364113557ed681d775ccbd3c90895ed276956a2= from
assets/sprites, which now contains our two trees and =hero.png=.

#+begin_example
  contents["assets/"] = [
    sprites: Tree 6364113557ed681d775ccbd3c90895ed276956a2 ]
  contents[""] = # Root!
    [ README: GitIndexEntry ]
#+end_example

Assets in turn becomes tree =4d35513cb6d2a816bc00505be926624440ebbddd=, so:

#+begin_example
  contents[""] = # Root!
    [ README: GitIndexEntry,
      assets: 4d35513cb6d2a816bc00505be926624440ebbddd]
#+end_example

We make a tree from that last key (with the =README= blob and the
=assets= subtree), it hashes to
=9352e52ff58fa9bf5a750f090af64c09fa6a3d93=.  That's our return value:
the tree whose contents are the same as the index's.

Here's the actual function:

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def tree_from_index(repo, index):
      contents = dict()
      contents[""] = list()

      # Enumerate entries, and turn them into a dictionary where keys
      # are directories, and values are lists of directory contents.
      for entry in index.entries:
          dirname = os.path.dirname(entry.name)

          # We create all dictonary entries up to root ("").  We need
          # them *all*, because even if a directory holds no files it
          # will contain at least a tree.
          key = dirname
          while key != "":
              if not key in contents:
                  contents[key] = list()
              key = os.path.dirname(key)

          # For now, simply store the entry in the list.
          contents[dirname].append(entry)

      # Get keys (= directories) and sort them by length, descending.
      # This means that we'll always encounter a given path before its
      # parent, which is all we need, since for each directory D we'll
      # need to modify its parent P to add D's tree.
      sorted_paths = sorted(contents.keys(), key=len, reverse=True)

      # This variable will store the current tree's SHA-1.  After we're
      # done iterating over our dict, it will contain the hash for the
      # root tree.
      sha = None

      # We ge through the sorted list of paths (dict keys)
      for path in sorted_paths:
          # Prepare a new, empty tree object
          tree = GitTree()

          # Add each entry to our new tree, in turn
          for entry in contents[path]:
              # An entry can be a normal GitIndexEntry read from the
              # index, or a tree we've created.
              if isinstance(entry, GitIndexEntry): # Regular entry (a file)

                  # We transcode the mode: the entry stores it as integers,
                  # we need an octal ASCII representation for the tree.
                  leaf_mode = "{:02o}{:04o}".format(entry.mode_type, entry.mode_perms).encode("ascii")
                  leaf = GitTreeLeaf(mode = leaf_mode, path=os.path.basename(entry.name), sha=entry.sha)
              else: # Tree.  We've stored it as a pair: (basename, SHA)
                  leaf = GitTreeLeaf(mode = b"040000", path=entry[0], sha=entry[1])

              tree.items.append(leaf)

          # Write the new tree object to the store.
          sha = object_write(tree, repo)

          # Add the new tree hash to the current dictionary's parent, as
          # a pair (basename, SHA)
          parent = os.path.dirname(path)
          base = os.path.basename(path) # The name without the path, eg main.go for src/main.go
          contents[parent].append((base, sha))

      return sha
#+end_src

This was the hard part; I hope it's clear enough.  From this, creating
the commit object and updating HEAD will be way easier.  Just remember
that what this function /does/ is built and store as many tree objects
as needed to represent the index, and return the root tree's SHA-1.

The function to create a commit object is simple enough, it just takes
some arguments: the hash of the tree, the hash of the parent commit,
the author's identity (a string), the timestamp and timezone delta,
and the message:

# @TODO Explain them!

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def commit_create(repo, tree, parent, author, timestamp, message):
      commit = GitCommit() # Create the new commit object.
      commit.kvlm[b"tree"] = tree.encode("ascii")
      if parent:
          commit.kvlm[b"parent"] = parent.encode("ascii")

      # Format timezone
      offset = int(timestamp.astimezone().utcoffset().total_seconds())
      hours = offset // 3600
      minutes = (offset % 3600) // 60
      tz = "{}{:02}{:02}".format("+" if offset > 0 else "-", hours, minutes)

      author = author + timestamp.strftime(" %s ") + tz

      commit.kvlm[b"author"] = author.encode("utf8")
      commit.kvlm[b"committer"] = author.encode("utf8")
      commit.kvlm[None] = message.encode("utf8")

      return object_write(commit, repo)
#+end_src

All what remains to write is =cmd_commit=, the bridge function to the
=wyag commit= command:

#+begin_src python :tangle libwyag.py
  def cmd_commit(args):
      repo = repo_find()
      index = index_read(repo)
      # Create trees, grab back SHA for the root tree.
      tree = tree_from_index(repo, index)

      # Create the commit object itself
      commit = commit_create(repo,
                             tree,
                             object_find(repo, "HEAD"),
                             gitconfig_user_get(gitconfig_read()),
                             datetime.now(),
                             args.message)

      # Update HEAD so our commit is now the tip of the active branch.
      active_branch = branch_get_active(repo)
      if active_branch: # If we're on a branch, we update refs/heads/BRANCH
          with open(repo_file(repo, os.path.join("refs/heads", active_branch)), "w") as fd:
              fd.write(commit + "\n")
      else: # Otherwise, we update HEAD itself.
          with open(repo_file(repo, "HEAD"), "w") as fd:
              fd.write("\n")
#+end_src

And we're done!

* Final words

** Conclusion, and beyond commit :noexport:

With that final command, =wyag= is done.  I hope you've enjoyed that
little journey into the internals of git core.  Obviously, we're still
very far from what the real git can do, but the goal was to expose the
model, and this is done.

One of the most fundamental design choices of git, which you've
probably noticed, is that it only stores full states of the
repository.  We like to think of commits as /transformations/ of
source code, and it makes sense to us because in a way that's what
they /are/, but to git itself each commit is like a zip of a
directory, as disconnected to the previous as it is to the “next”.
Git neither knows nor cares about deltas and patches, and even file
renames indications are just a trick. (To be perfectly honest: it
actually /knows/ about deltas, but as a storage optimization method,
in packfiles --- which are optional).
